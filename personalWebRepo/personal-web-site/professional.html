        <h2>Google Research and Machine Intelligence Software Engineering Intern</h2>
        <p>In between my Junior and Senior years of college I was a Software Engineering intern with Google Research and MI in Mountain View, CA. I interned for the team which developed Google Lens. Unfortunately much of my work at Google was confidential, however, I can say that I worked to develop an internal computer vision API, which will likely be used in Google products in the future. I also developed some tools to help Google engineers do very advanced Machine Learning Research. I largely developed for iOS while at Google. Of course, while at Google I significantly honed my development skills, grew accustomed to Google’s unique and respected way of doing things, and also became familiar with Google’s effective means of development.</p>
        <h2>DST Systems Architect Intern</h2>
        	<p>During the summer between my sophomore and freshman years of college I was a systems architect intern at DST Systems. DST is a fairly large company in Kansas City, which handles the movement of important information like mutual fund transactions or pharmaceutical information movement. The internship was paid and DST paid for my housing for the summer. As an intern I worked on DST’s flagship software AWD, which helps bureaucracies function within a business. I developed interfaces for inputting client information into several different databases. I also helped DST integrate Splunk into their systems. Splunk is a data-mining program for searching through error logs. When I began my internship, Splunk was new to DST. The engineers wanted to use Splunk to detect why their systems were failing and predict the next failures. I used Splunk to index DST’s 100s of millions of error logs to make the error logs more accessible to the engineers. Because Splunk was so new to DST I was one of the most influential engineers in its integration. Indexing AWD’s error logs also familiarized me with the workings of a complex system. I was the only intern with my team, so I was largely treated like a full time employee. I attended major product development meetings and I learned how businesses function. </p>
