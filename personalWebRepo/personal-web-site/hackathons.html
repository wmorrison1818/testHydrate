        <h1>Hackathons</h1>
<p>Hackathons are weekend long programming sessions where a group of people get together, have some fun, and make an app. Hackathons are great ways to meet new people, learn new skills, and see new places. Sometimes I go to hackathons for fun, and sometimes I go to hackathons to compete for a prize. I always make a hack at every hackathon though.</p>
		  <h2>Hack Mizzou- Columbia, MO, November 2014</h2>
<p>Hack Mizzou was my first hackathon and one of the most fun and successful hackathons I have been to so far. My team was comprised of 2 other Mizzou students and 2 Purdue students. Our app was Pill Bug, a Pebble Smart Watch App. We used C and JavaScript to make the app. We also used firebase for the backend and, of course, the Pebble SDK to make the app. The app reminded patients when to take their pills. I had a lot of fun playing with cutting edge tech, playing games with friends, and eating great food. We won the most Innovative Health Care App which was awarded to us by Cerner. </p>
		  <h2>Hack Illinois- Champaign Urbana, IL, January 2015</h2>
<p>Hack Illinois was the first huge hackathon that I attended. Major companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook were at Hack Illinois and people from all over the country were there too. Because of the large amount of events I made an easy hack on my own. I called the hack iCMS. ICMS allowed users to build and upload websites in full HTML and CSS. I would later use the technology in iCMS to develop Website Village. I used firebase for the backend and Objective C to build the app itself. </p>

			<h2>Hack Midwest- Kansas City, MO, July 2015</h2>
<p>Hack Midwest was a fairly small hackathon for both students and professionals. I worked with 1 undergraduate, 1 graduate, and a professional from Cerner. We built an app we called Fat Dog. Fat Dog used the Fit Bit and Fit Bark to track a dog and his or her owner’s health and compare the 2.</p>
			
			<h2>Hack Wash U- St. Louis, MO, November 2015</h2>
<p>Hack Wash U was a fun midsized hackathon. At Hack Wash U I worked with a team comprised of another Mizzou student, a Washington University student, and high school student. We built a game called Trippy, which used the Trip Adviser API to output comments from random places all over the world, and the user had to guess where the comments came from in the world. Trippy was a hybrid app which utilized the Google Maps API. Trippy was one of the Top 5 apps at Hack Wash U.</p>
		  
		  			<h2>Hack Illinois- Champaign Urbana, IL, February 2016</h2>
<p>Hack Illinois 2016 was the second Hack Illinois I attended. Again because of the great number of events to attend I made an easy hack. I created a team comprised of 2 of my friends from Mizzou. We built an app called PoliStat which displayed Google Trends Data related to presidential primary candidates. PoliStat was a hybrid app which used Firebase as its backend.</p>
		  
		  		  			<h2>Base Hacks- Sunnyvale, CA, June 2016</h2>
<p>Base Hacks was a mid sized hackathon in Microsoft’s Sunnyvale campus. Base Hacks was a 20 hour hackathon as opposed to the other hackathons I had been to, which were usually 36 hour hackathons. I worked on a team with a student from Mizzou, another college student, and a couple high school students. We built an app called Bartir which was a bot like Siri which enabled a user to post a job and pay another to do a job. Bartir was a web app which used Firebase as its backend.</p>

		  			<h2>HackANapp- San Francisco, CA, June 2016</h2>
<p>HackANapp was a small hackathon hosted by Ads Native, an advertising technology start up, in downtown San Francisco. My team was composed of a Stanford undergrad, a University of Waterloo undergrad, and two graduate students. For hackANapp we built an app called Friendsy which took multiple friends’ locations and found points of interest between the friends. Ads were a part of the map. Friendsy was a Hybrid App which utilized the Google Maps API. hackANapp was unique because it granted insight into start up culture in San Francisco.</p>
