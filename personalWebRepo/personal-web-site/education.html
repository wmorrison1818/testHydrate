        <h1>Education</h1>
<p>I am currently enrolled at the University of Missouri, Columbia as a Computer Science Major, and intend to graduate in May of 2018. At the University of Missouri, or Mizzou, I have already taken several computer science courses which are listed below. Realize these courses do not encapsulate all of my knowledge in computer science; for example, I have never taken a course in iOS at Mizzou, yet I largely lead iOS development in a lab at Mizzou. To fully understand all that I know you must both consider my experiences and my coursework. I have taken more many more CS classes since this was first written, but have been unable to add them here yet. These classes include AI, Software Engineering, OS, Assembly Language, and more.  </p>
		<h2>General Computer Science Courses (CS 1050-3050)</h2>
<p>Mizzou’s general CS courses number CS 1050-4050; I have already taken 1050-3050 and will take 4050 in the fall. The first course is intro to programming where the basics of programming are taught. The second course introduces basic data structures, slightly more sophisticated programming, and well-known algorithms. The third course heavily studies data structure and more complex algorithms. The third course focuses on algorithms like Breadth and Depth First Search, Greedy Algorithms, and Heapsort. We studied data structures like Heaps, Red-Black Trees, and Hashes. All of these courses were primarily taught in C, and these courses comprise most of what I know about C.</p>
		<h2>Object Oriented Programming </h2>
<p>Object Oriented Programming taught the basics of Object Oriented Programming. The course largely solidified my already strong knowledge of the OOP. Object Oriented Programming was taught in Java 8 and solidified my knowledge of Java while teaching me new things about Java and Java 8. I learned how to multithread in Java in this class while also utilizing lambda expressions with Java 8. I built a project at the end of the class called Mentor which utilized Firebase to create a sharing economy app for teachers.</p>
		<h2>Database</h2>
<p>Database taught basic backend skills. We used Azure in Database to host our databases. Our Azure hosted databases were Linux environments which we programed with PHP and MySQL. Database solidified my rather weak knowledge of backend technologies while also familiarizing me with MySQL. At the end of the course, a team and I created a website for Mizzou’s library system which enabled librarians to check out books. </p>
